  <meta name='twitter:description' content="Functional Programming in JavaScript, is hard, difficult to understand, and you need a PhD in applied maths to use it in production. In this talk Iâ€™ll try to explain why that's not the truth by showing a practical approach to some fundamental FP concepts and how to apply them to your code base today. By the end of the talk you'll hopefully have some understanding on some Functional Programming principles and how to apply them to your code base but most importantly when and how apply those principles" />

## Setting the expectations

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>No math!</li>
  <li>This is <b>not</b> a comprehensive FP talk</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

Before the Functional Programming police takes me in for questioning let me set the expectation
No math will be harmed in this talk
This is just the tip of the iceberg

## So why Functional Programming?

```notes
Time slot 2 minutes
Warning: the following snippets contains PHP!
Just to give you a bit of context and make you understand where I'm coming from

<CodeSurfer

theme={codeTheme}
showNumbers
code={require('raw-loader!./snippets/01.php')}
/>

```notes
In another life I was a PHP developer, where to loop over an array the foreach is the most common way.
I always tought, there has to be better way to do this
```

```notes
I found out that the array_walk function can iterate throgh an array and pass a callback to each item, I fell in love with that particular function.
```

## And why JavaScript?

#### Why didn't you choose <br/> {insert here super cool Functional Programming Language} rather than JavaScript?
#### It's so much better because <br />{list here reason why other languages are better than JS}
---
List reson for javascript being awesome:
- FP from SCHEMA
- OOP and FP can mix and that's some of the true strenght

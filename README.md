# JavaScript Functional Programming: Our misunderstood friend

Functional Programming in JavaScript, is hard, difficult to understand, and you need a PhD in applied maths to use it in production

In this talk Iâ€™ll try to explain why that's not the truth by showing a practical approach to some fundamental FP concepts and how to apply them to your code base today.

By the end of the talk you'll hopefully have some understanding on some Functional Programming principles and how to apply them to your code base but most importantly when and how apply those principles; After all "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors." right?

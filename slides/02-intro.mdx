# Functional Programming 
```notes
Today I want to talk about FP, and why you should cosider usinng it
This talk aims to make the people understand what Functional Programming is and what it stands for and hopefully give you some real world tips that you can use in your code today. 
```
---
## We'll cover: 
<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>The one reason why I think FP makes code better</li>
  <li><i>Some</i> FP terminology</li>
  <li>How you can start using FP concepts today</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
We'll cover three main areas:
- The one reason I think functional programming makes my code better, there are so many things that we can talk about but I chose to focus on only one that in my opinion is the most important
- I'd like to cover some of the fundamental keywords about functional programming to make the communication more effective, no math tough I promise
- I'll then show you how you can start using what we'll cover in your code
```

# Warning: Danger ahead ‚ö†Ô∏è
```notes
Before we go any further a little disclaimer: This is not a comprehensive functional programming talk, this talk is  what I learnt from banging my head against the wall for past couple of years and help you not doing the same, if you are a functional programmer you might want to cover your eyes and ears now
```

## FP is declarative rather than imperative
<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Imperative: how to achieve something</li>
  <li>Declarative: what should be achieved</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- Recent studies demonstrate that the
- human brain good at figuring out what should happen
- but not how to do efficiently 
- computer is exceptionally good at following instructions 
- ah-ha moment: CSS engine
- Struggled to find a good example that is not the usual for loop 
- testing framewors

## Pure Function

<ul>
<Appear>
<li>Given the same input, the function returns the same output</li>
<li>The function doesn't cause side effects outside of the function's scope</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Every functional programming talk has to start with the function in particular the types of functions we'll use

A pure function is a function that satisfies the following conditions:

Given the same input, the function returns the same output

The function doesn't cause side effects outside of the function's scope

Here an example of an pure function

```notes
Why function purity
- easy to reason with
- easy to reuse
- easy to test
```

showNumbers
code={require('raw-loader!./../snippets/02-01-function-purity.js')}
/>

```notes
An impure function like this one makes impossible to predict out of the context of the sorrounding code.

You have to read the whole code to undestand what's happening, now some of you JS expert might argue about using const rather than let
(next)

```notes
 arrays and objects are passed by reference in JavaScript so you can find yourself in a situation like this one.

## Expression of Intent

<Appear>
<span>Mapper, </span>
<span>Predicate</span>
<span> and Reducer Functions</span>
</Appear>

```notes

There are some specific names in functional programming that make the communication much easier, for instance:

- A mapper function, a function that transforms the input and returns an output

- A predicate function, a function that returns either true or false

- A reducer function, a function that combines (or reduces) two values into one 

Not spending too much time now as it'll be clear later on
```

## Setting the expectations

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>No math!</li>
  <li><i>some</i> FP terminology</li>
  <li>Walk away with something you can use today</li>
  <li>This is <b>not</b> a comprehensive FP talk</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Before the Functional Programming police takes me in for questioning let me set the expectation:

- No math will be harmed in this talk, functional programming uses mathematical concepts it's true but in my opinion they make things harder to understand

- I will cover however some terminology, so when somebody tells you that he create a new binary function you don't look at that person like an alien 

- With this talk I aim to give you something that can either make you understand better Functional Programming or ideas on how to make your code more functional
This is not a comprehensive FP talk but (next slide) it's just the beginning

## So why Functional Programming?

```notes
Time slot 4 minutes

## Declarative rather than Imperative
<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Imperative: how to achieve something?</li>
  <li>Declarative: what should be achieved?</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
I can spend hours explaining why FP should be used but I think the most important one (at least for me is Declarative Vs Imperative) how to achieve somenting vs what should be achieved, I struggled a lot to find an example that wasn't the usual for loop to show the impertative approach and and the use of the map function to show the declarative approach so I went for something different but hopefully will send a better message

 Why didn't you choose <br/> <b>{insert here super cool Functional Programming Language}</b> rather than JavaScript?

<br />

 X it's so much better because <br /><b>{list here reasons why other languages are better than JS}</b>
---
List reson for javascript being awesome:
JavaScript is multi-paradigm programming language (Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming live in harmony)
- FP from SCHEMA
- OOP and FP can mix and that's some of the true strenght
